          <div class="col-md-9"><p style="text-align:justify">Dear Indians, all of you are welcome in the Satya Kama Foundation Trust family. Our institution is an institution registered under the Constitution of India, 1882 Act, Trust Act, which was established on October 4, 2019 in the state of Bihar. We Indians, a few months after our independence 75 years. Months are about to be celebrated. Despite the passage of 75 years of independence, the problem in our country remains the same. The average of people living below the poverty line in our country is above 37%, even today in our country better is better. The problems of education and health of the people remain as it is. Even today people are forced to migrate from one city to another for the maintenance of their family. That is, even today in our country the severe crisis of unemployment is becoming a big obstacle in the common life. Even after 75 years of independence, the children and elders of our country are in signal, rail, tourist places,They are living the life of begging at the shrine. Even today people are forced to live their lives around the pavement and dirty drains. It may be that we Indians are not self-reliant, some people also believe that the rapidly increasing population in the country is a hindrance to our development, but or their attitude may be because countries with a larger population than us are on the path of continuous development. Moving forward, in comparison to other developing countries, more than 60% of India's population depends on the government public welfare scheme, which spends a large part of our country's GDP every year. That is, every year the government gives us no temporary solution.In comparison to our country, every citizen of the developing country remains self-reliant to increase the GDP of his government and help the government in every possible way by paying taxes in nation building.It is clear that we empty our treasury every year compared to other developing countries, due to which the pace of our development becomes slow and weak. </p></div>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> And the result is in front of us, help from big companies and governments of other developing countries,There is no other option in front of us other than to make investment, this is the biggest obstacle to our development, you will be able to understand these things in such a way that if a foreign company invests in our country, then it helps us less and earn profit. For does more business than us, the poor condition of our government is so bad that the government tries to explain to reduce the tax on foreign products, as a result of which the foreign product becomes cheaper in our country and the product is sold more and that The profit from us is less than you may believe, in such a situation, what is the honey of our country, we also get the product cheap. The matter is very simple and straightforward, the foreign company who earns profit on the product goes out of our country. Whose benefit we Indians are not able to get, whereas if we become Indians, then a large part of the profits earned by us will be paid to the government in the form of tax.And there will always be an increase in our GDP, the benefits of which will be passed on to us only by the important steps taken by the government. Due to the high tax on the products, the product becomes expensive, due to which the product of our country is sold less and we also get less profit, due to which the indigenous companies choose various types of constitutional efforts to avoid paying the tax. In such situations, companies often go bankrupt or close, now you must have understood how important it has become for us Indians to become self-reliant. India provides a huge opportunity, which is being looked at by the governments and companies of the whole world.Only and only sees from the point of view of the successful market, if we Indians have not learned anything from this even after 75 years of our independence, then our result is going to remain the same and then that day is not far away, we will again go to any foreign company or Will be the slaves of the government.
